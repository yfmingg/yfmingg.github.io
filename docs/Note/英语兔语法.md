## 动词

### 分类

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[实义动词]-->B[按动作承受者划分]
    A[实义动词]-->C[按动作/状态划分]
    B --> 不及物动词
    B --> 单及物动词
    B --> 双及物动词   
    C --> 动作动词 --- eat
    C --> 状态动词 --- have/belive
```

系动词可以被列入不及物动词或状态动词

### 谓语动词

实义动词和系动词可以单独做谓语动词。助动词、情态动词不能单独做谓语动词，是用来辅助主动词构成谓语动词

动词原形，无“时”无“态”。非谓语动词，无“时”有“态”。谓语动词，有“时”有“态”

动词时态： 动词原型、动词现在式（即根据主语是否是第三人称单数+s/es/sh）、动词过去式（一般+ed）、现在分词（一般+ing）、过去分词（一般+ed）

过去式 vs 过去分词:

- 过去式表示主动、过去，有时间内涵，通常用作谓语，是一个完整独立的时态。用于一般过去时态中，表示过去发生的事情，表示短暂的动作。
- 过去分词表示被动或者完成，没有时间内涵，属于非谓语，相当于形容词或副词，不是一个完整独立的时态。表示完成，一般表示持续性的动作。

### 系动词

系动词又称连系动词，即将系动词后面的性质赋予主语

- I am a rabbit.
- The rabbit is smart.

### 助动词

辅助主动词构成谓语动词，情态动词是助动车的一种

- The rabbit ate a carrot. // 表过去，通过eat的过去式ate的变位来表达过去
- The rabbit eats a carrot. // 表现在，动词原型表现在
- The rabbit will eat a carrot. // 表将来，无法通过eat变为表将来，需要will来辅助
- The bus leaves at 8.pm tonight. // 一般现在时表将来
- The bus will leave at 8.pm tonight. // 一般将来时

> 基本助动词： be / do / have

- The rabbit is eating a carrot. // is辅助构成现在进行时态
- The rabbit dose likes coins. // dose 表强调
-The rabbit has eaten a carrot. // has辅助构成现在完成时

> 情态助动词：

can/could

1. 表请求许可: Can/Could I borrow your book?  could比can更诚恳
2. 表可能性: Anything can/could happen.  could表对过去的推测
3. 有能力做/会/可以：I can kill a wolf.

may/might

1. 表请求许可： May/Might I borrow your book?   might比may更礼貌
2. 表可能性,但可能性小于can/could： The rabbit isn't here. He may at home.
3. 表祝愿，放句首：May you succeed! 祝你成功

> 半助词：

I will be able to reach the school if I leave right now. // be able to 表将来，was/were able to 成功做成某事

I'm going to eat dinner at 6.pm today. // be going to 表主观能动行，计划做某事

be about to // 马上就要做

You are to finish homework first. // be to 被命令做

I think they are to fall in love with each other. // 命中注定

You had better follow my order. // 最好做，忠告，警告之意

### 使役动词

表达使、让、令的含义的动词

后接宾语+宾补，宾补可以是动词原型(或叫裸不定式)、形容词、副词、过去分词。。。

常用使役动词：

- make: 迫使xx做xx
- let: 允许xx做xx
- have: 给xx责任/任务
- get: 说服/鼓励xx做xx

## 时态

动作时间（现在、过去、将来、过去将来）和 动作状态（一般、完成、进行、完成进行）组合共16种

### 现在

> 一般现在时: S + V-s/es/sh

1. 表达事实
2. 表达习惯、重复的动作
3. 表达预计 发⽣的事: The bus leaves at 8.pm tonight.

> 现在进行时：be + V-ing(现在分词)

1. 表达某事在说话时正在 进⾏ 。
2. 表达某些事在将来要发⽣ 。 We are going to Paris next week.

1. 表达⼀件事情已经完成

> 现在完成进行时：have/has been V-ing(现在分词)

1. 表达⼀件事在某⼀时间内发⽣了但还未结束

### 过去

> 一般过去时：S + V-ed(过去式)

表达⼀件事在过去某时刻已完成

> 过去进行时：was/were + V-ing(现在分词)

辨析：现在完成时(对现在有影响，I have gone to Shanghai,去了未回) vs 一般过去时（对现在没影响，I went to Shanghai,去了已回）

> 过去完成时：had + V-ed(过去分词)

表达过去某一时间点的过去对该点的影响.  He was tired because he hadn't sleep well.

> 过去完成进行时：had + been + V-ing(现在分词)

对于过去某个时间点,不但已经完成⼀部分,⽽且还在过去那点之后，继续进行一段时间

### 将来

> 一般将来时： will + V（动词原型）

表达将来某个时间点发⽣的动作 (说话者 ⼗分确定的 事)

> 将来进行时： will + be + V-ing(现在分词)

表达在将来某个时间,某个动作是在进⾏的过程中。(特别笃定某事⼀定发⽣）

> 将来完成时： will + have + V-ed(过去分词)

表达将来某⼀点A的过去某点B（点B可能是现在的过去，也可能是现在和点A之间），对将来点A的影响（表达特别特别确定的事）

The rabbit will have eaten a carrot tomorrow.

> 将来完成进行时： will + have + been + V-ing

表达对于将来某个点,不但已经完成了⼀部分,⽽且还要继续进⾏的动作。

You will have been watching my video. // 将来某⼀时间后, 看了,还要继续看⼀段时间

### 过去将来

> 一般过去将来时：would + V  /   was/were going to （would是will的过去式）

表示过去的将来

I said I would eat a carrot for lunch. // 我过去说，我会在过去的将来吃胡罗卜

I knew you would watch my video.

> 过去将来进行时： would + be + V-ing(现在分词)

I said I would be eating a carrot at 1pm tomorrow. // 我过去说，我明天下午1点将会正在吃胡罗卜

> 过去将来完成时：would + have + V-ed(过去分词)

I said I would have eaten a carrot by 1pm tomorrow. //我过去说，我到明天下午1点已经吃了一个胡罗卜

> 过去将来完成进行时：would + have + been + V-ing(现在分词)

I said I would have been eating lunch for 2 hours by 1pm tomorrow. //我过去说，我明天下午1点正在吃中饭，之前已经吃了2小时，后面还会继续吃。

## 虚拟语气

时态后退原则

### 表示不可能假设

描述脑中的想象，或与现实相反的，的主观意愿

> 与现在事实相反：条件句 过去式，主句 would+动词原型

If I knew it, I would tell you.

If I saw the rabbit now, I would bite him. // 虽有now，但虚拟语气与时间无关系，只要求谓语动词变化正确

> 与将来事实相反：条件句 should+动词原型，主句 would+动词原型，表真的不可能或可能性很小

If I should see the rabbit tomorrow, I would bite hime.

If should meet thee after long years, how should I great thee.
// 万一我们将来重逢，我该如何面对你呢（暗示咱俩相会，遥遥无期）

> 与过去事实相反: 条件句 had+过去分词，主句 would have+过去分词，假设对过去某一点有影响

If I had watched this videos before, I would have aced my test.

If I had seen the rabbit a few days ago, I would have bitten him.

### 表达愿望、请求、建议、命令等

希望某个动作/行为发生

> 对现在的希望： wish + 动词过去式

I wish I were a rabbit.

I wish You were here

> 对过去的希望：wish + had/would have + 动词过去分词

I wish I had eaten the carrots.

> 对将来的希望：wish + should/would/could/might + 动词原型

I wish I would eat the carrots.

demand suggest insist order ...+ (should) + 动词原型

It is high time that you ate a carrots. // ate虚拟语气，定语从句

> wish = would rather

I would rather that you didn't eat the carrots. // 现在希望，还没吃

I would rather that you hadn't eaten the carrots. // 对过去希望，已经吃了

## 非谓语动词

- 谓语动词： 限制性动词，即受主语限制
- 非谓语动词：非限制性动词，即不受主语限制
- 非谓语动词可以充当除谓语外的所有句子成分，一定程度上简化了从句，使表达意思言简意赅

I like to eat carrots. // 不定式

I liked eating carrots. // 动名词，a carrot for eating

I'm a talking rabbit. // 现在分词

The rabbit likes minced carrots. // 过分分词

### 不定式

to + 动词原型

> 做主语：

To eat a carrot every day is good for the rabbit. // 只看to eat 不知道谁吃，也不知道过去还是将来吃，所以叫不定式

It is good for the rabbit to eat a carrot every day. // 可转it做形式主语

It is good that the rabbit eats a carrot every day. // 主语从句，it形式主语，后从句是真正主语

> 做宾语：

The rabbit likes to eat carrots.

> 做宾补：

The rabbit excepted the wolf to eat a carrot.

感官动词/使役动词 see/find/watch/have/make/let后面用不定式做宾补时，需省略to

You helped me (to) cook the carrot.

Carrots make rabbit feel happy.

> 做定语：

The rabbit has a lot of carrots to eat.

> 做状语（表达原因、目的、结果）：

I was surprised to get a thumbs-up. // 表原因

I was surprised beacause I got a thumbs-up. // 该写成原因状语从句

I will do anything to get a thumbs-up. // 表目的

I will do anything in order that I get a thumbs-up. // 该写成目的状语从句

I got enough thumbs-up to make annother video. // 表结果

I got enough thumbs-up, so that I made annother video. // 该写成结果状语从句

> 高级不定式：to + 动词原型的基础上增加表示状态

The rabbit seemed to be eating a carrot. // 兔子之前似乎正在吃一个胡萝卜

The rabbit will appear to have eaten a carrot. // 兔子之后会看起来好像已经吃了一个胡罗卜

### 动名词

本质相当于名词，动词原型+ing

> 做主语：

Eating carrot is healthy for rabbit.

> 做表语：

The rabbit's hobby is growing carrot.  // 眼见为实  Seeing is beliving.

> 做定语：

a sleeping pill  => a pill for sleeping

> 做宾语：The rabbit likes eating carrots.

以下动词后只能用动名词：enjoy/avoid/advise/consider/escape/mind/practice/insist on/give up/feel like/put off

The rabbit enjoys eating carrot.

与不定式做宾语的区别：

The rabbit stoped to eat a carrot. // 停下手里的活去吃一根胡罗卜，foget to do 忘记去做，未做

The rabbit stoped eating a carrot. // 停止吃一根， foget doing 忘记做过，已做

> 介宾=介词+宾语

The rabbit is fond of eating carrots. fond(adj), of eating(介宾)

The rabbit is looking forward to seeing the wolf again. // look forward 期待；盼望,  to seeing(介宾)

### 现在分词

基本相当形容词，不一定自带现在属性，也可充当副词

现在进行时 = be + 现在分词

> 与动名词的区分

a sleeping pill  => a pill for sleeping // 动名词用来说明药片的性质、作用、功能

a sleeping rabbit != a rabbit for sleeping // 现在分词相当于形容词，修饰兔子的状态

> 做副词：修饰紧跟着的形容词

We are having a ripping good time // ripping 相当于very

> 做定语:

a taking rabbit.

> 做表语：

The rabbit is charming. // 暗含主动关系，描述的是作出动作的人、物

The story is interesting.

> 做宾补：

The wolf saw the rabbit eating a carrot. // 现在分词做宾补，表示正在，强调动作状态

The wolf saw the rabbit eat a carrot. // 此处是不定式，to省略了，强调动作已经发生

> 做状语：

Hearing the news, the rabbit became excited. // 表时间

When he heard the news, the rabbit became excited. // 时间状语从句

Not knowing what to eat, the rabbit skiped lunch. // 表原因

Because he didn't what to eat, the rabbit skiped lunch. // 原因状语从句

### 过去分词

不带时间含义，不表示过去时间，动词原型+ed，但也有很多不规则变化

单独一个过去分词相当于形容词，an excited rabbit.

过去分词短语做定语，在放置在被修饰名词的后面，即后置定语，The carrot cake eaten by the rabbit is delicious.

> 做表语：暗含被动关系，被描述的是动作的接受者

The rabbit is interested in growing carrots.

> 做宾补：

The rabbit found his carrots stolen.

> 做状语：

Seen from the hill, the carrot field looks beautiful. //表地点，the carrot field(胡罗卜田是主语)，与seen是被动的关系，被看

Born in the rabbit family, the rabbit's only work is growing carrot. //表原因

> 与现在分词的区别，主语与动词之间是被动还是主动关系，过去分词表被动，现在分词表主动

The work finished, the rabbit went home. // 工作完成了，兔子才回家

The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out.

## 独立主格

逻辑主语与真正主语不一致，相对“独立”

Because the wolf invited him, the rabbit decided to go to the party. // 不是独立主格，invited是相对于真正主语rabbit来变位的，用过去分词表被动，即被邀请

The wolf inviting him, the rabbit decided to go to the party. //是独立主格，inviting相对逻辑主语 wolf 来变位，用现在分词表主动，即主动邀请

### 对从句的简化

If the weather permits, the rabbit will go out. // 条件状语从句

The weather permitting, the rabbit will go out. // 简化

After the work was finished, the rabbit went home. // 时间状语从句

The work finished, the rabbit went home. // 简化

The rabbit is lying in the bed and a carrot is still held in his hand. // 要加is

The rabbit is lying in the bed, a carrot held in his hand. // 不要is

名词/代词 + 不定式: The rabbit to come, the wolf is overjoyed. // 表将要发生的动作

名词/代词 + 名词: Many animals went to the parth, some of them rabbits and wolves. // some 代词，rabbit and wolves 名词

名词/代词 + 形容词: Many animals went to the parth, some of them happy.

名词/代词 + 副词: The rabbit sat on the chair, head down. // 头垂着睡着了，head名词，down副词

名词/代词 + 介词短语: The rabbit came in, carrot in hand.

> 综上，这些句子更像是包含be的独立主格，即名词/代词 + be的现在分词（being）,然后省略being

Many animals went to the parth, some of them (being) rabbits and wolves. // some 代词，rabbit and wolves 名词

Many animals went to the parth, some of them (being) happy.

The rabbit sat on the chair, head (being) down. // 头垂着睡着了，head名词，down副词

The rabbit came in, carrot (being) in hand.

### 独立主格结构

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[非谓语动词] ---> 过去分词 --- 逻辑主语与动作是被动完成关系
    A ---> 现在分词 --- 逻辑主语与动作是主动进行关系
    A ---> 不定式 --- 逻辑主语将要发生的动作

```

with + 宾语 + 宾补

The work finished, the rabbit went to home.

With work finished, the rabbit went to hoem. // with可省略

The rabbit came in, with a carrot in his hand.

The rabbit came in, carrot in his hand.

## 从句

### 定语从句：形容词性从句、关系从句

The rabbit is eating a carrot(先行词) that(关系词) I bought.

- 关系代词：that/who/whom/whose/which
- 关系副词：where/why/when

| 陈述句      | 替换关系代词 | 关系代词提句首 |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------|
| I bought a carrot      | I bought that| that I bought|
| The rabbit ate a carrot   | who ate a carrot  |  who ate a carrot |
| I saw the teacher yesterday | I saw whom yesterday | whom I saw  yesterday |
|The teacher's favorite food is carrot | whose favorite food is carrot| whose favorite food is carrot|
|The teacher likes the food| The teacher likes which| which the teacher likes which|

> that vs which

- 先行词是唯一的用that: The rabbit ate the carrot that I have ever seen. // all/the only/the first等
- 先行词是多选一用which:  The rabbit is eating a carrot which/that I bought.

关系副词可以转化为关系代词，即where/why/when =  at which / for which (介词+which)

- 限制性形容词性从句：The rabbit ate the carrots which was on the table. // 限定carrot的范围，桌子上的那一根，本来有很多根
- 非限制性形容词性从句：可做插入语解释说明，也可代指整句话
- The rabbit ate the carrots, which was on the table. // 只有一根胡罗卜，恰巧在桌子上
- The biggest carrot, which the rabbit ate, was on the table. // 最大的胡罗卜在桌子上，兔子吃了它
- My head, which is big, is useful when it rains. // 我有大头，下雨不愁

### 名词性从句

> 主语从句：句子主语有从句充当，要以引导词开头, where/when/who/what/that/whether/how

The fact is obvious. ==> That the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious. // that是从属连词

|主语从句|含义|
|--|--|
|That the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.| 兔子吃了胡罗卜 |
|Whether the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.| 是否吃，连接副词 |
|Where the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.|  在哪吃，连接副词 |
|When the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.| 啥时候吃，连接副词 |
|How the rabbit ate a carrot is obvious.| 怎样吃，连接副词 |
|Who ate a carrot is obvious.| 谁吃胡罗卜是明显的，连接代词 |
|What the rabbit ate is obvious.| 兔子吃什么是明显的，连接代词 |

以上都可以转成it做形式主语，如whether：It is obvious whether the rabbit ate a carrot.

- It is suggested that you (should) eat a carrot. // 虚拟语气
- That you (should) eat a carrot is suggested. // 转主语从句

> 宾语从句：在复杂句中做宾语，包含确定信息和不确定信息

- I saw that the rabbit ate a carrot. // 确定信息

- I saw who ate the carrot.
- I saw what the rabbit ate.
- I saw where the rabbit ate a carrot.

某些词后的宾语从句的否定

- I think that the rabbit is smart. // 肯定句
- I don't think that the rabbit is smart. // 正确否定句
- I think that the rabbit isn't smart. // 错误否定句

主从时态一致

- I don't think you are right.
- I didn't think you were right. // 过去时
- I knew the rabbit liked carrots.
- I knew the sun rises in the east. // 不变的客观事实是例外

be + adj + that + 宾语从句：adj表达某种看法判断

- I am sure that there's a carrot on the table.
- I am happy that there's a carrot on the table.
- I am afraid that there's no carrot on the table.

> 表语从句：用一个从句做表语

- That the rabbit ate a carrot is secret. // 主语从句，两者强调的信息不一样
- The secret is that the rabbit ate a carrot. // 表语从句

> 同位语从句：可解释主语，也可解释宾语

- My teacher, Papa rabbit, likes carrots. // 同位语
- The fact that the rabbit eats a carrot did not surprise me. // 同位语从句，包含已知信息
- The question whether the rabbit will eat the carrot is on all our mind. // 同位语从句，包含未知信息

- In order that I could finish the video in time, I pulled an all-nighter. // 为了
- I pulled an all-nighter, so that I could finish the video in time. // so that 为了，不能放句首

目的状语从句一般使用情态动词can could may might should would,更能体现目的性
